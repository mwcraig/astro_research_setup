# Get to know the terminal

Although, strictly speaking, this isn't necessary for doing research, knowing
a little bit about how to use the terminal to do some basic things like create
directories (aka folders) is useful. Take a look at this
[online tutorial on using the terminal](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/),
and work your way through the sections up to and including "Remove Directory."
